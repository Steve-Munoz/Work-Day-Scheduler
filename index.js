// GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
// WHEN I open the planner
// THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
// WHEN I scroll down
// THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
// WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
// THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
// WHEN I click into a timeblock
// THEN I can enter an event
// WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
// THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
// WHEN I refresh the page
// THEN the saved events persist
// ```

//  I will first make sure javascript doesn't run until the HTML is finished loading

// using moment.js display current time
//console.log(moment().format("MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a"));

// create an array to add into html

// create a for loop to iterate through my timeblock array and add all my timeblocks to the webpage

// Declare variables for the elements you want to add in your container html

// add classes to each element on html page

// append your new Elements with their attached classes to html page

// I will write my functions below

//  Save to local storage once a button is clicked

// create a function to make sure your text in time block is saved and displayed on the webpage.

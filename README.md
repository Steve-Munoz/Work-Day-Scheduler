For this project I created a daily work planner, for an employee who wants to organize each hour of their work day and set reminders or to do tasks. I used javascript to create the main layout of the html page by created an array of 9am-5pm timeblocks and iterated through each index and assigned certain ID's and classes that had styling already in CSS. I also created functions to color code each timeblock so that the user knew if it was in the past present or future. I also created a function to display the users written message in each timeblock. I utilized local storage, so that user's text information would be saved regardless if they exited the page or refreshed the page.
